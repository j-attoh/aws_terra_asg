# AWS AutoScaling Group with Application Load Balancer 

This repository showcases the deployment of an AWS Autoscaling Group (ASG) utilizing Terraform, with an associated Application Load Balancer (ALB).
The ASG is configured to ensure high availability and scalability of the application, while the ALB distributes incoming traffic across instances in the ASG.

The main objective of this project is to set up an infrastructure that automatically scales based on demand and distributes incoming traffic efficiently.
The AWS Autoscaling Group ensures that the desired number of instances is maintained at all times, while the Application Load Balancer ensures even distribution of traffic among these instances.
